            </ul>
            <p>Please provide as much information as possible.</p>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-600 mt-8 mb-4">Confidentiality</h2>
            <p>
              <b>All reports will be kept confidential</b>. When we discuss incidents with people who are reported, we
              will anonymize details as much as we can to protect reporter privacy.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, some incidents happen in one-on-one interactions, and even if the details are anonymized, the
              reported person may be able to guess who made the report. If you have concerns about retaliation or your
              personal safety, please note those in your report. We still encourage you to report, so that we can
              support you while keeping our conference attendees safe. In some cases, we can compile several anonymized
              reports into a pattern of behavior, and take action on that pattern.
            </p>
            <p>
              In some cases, we may determine that a public statement will need to be made. If that's the case, the
              identities of all victims and reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us
              otherwise.
            </p>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-600 mt-8 mb-4">Report Handling Procedure</h2>
            <p>
              When you make a report to an incident responder, they will gather information about the incident according
              to the{" "}
              <b>
                <a
                  href="/2025/code-of-conduct/enforcement-procedures"
                  className="text-blue-700 underline"
                  target="_blank"
                >
                  Procedure For Incident Response
                </a>
              </b>
              .
            </p>
            <p>
              After an incident responder takes the report, they will immediately consult with the PyCon HK event staff,
              unless there is a conflict of interest, in which case any non-interested parties will be contacted.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the incident is ongoing and needs to be immediately addressed, any lead incident responder may take
              appropriate action to ensure the safety of everyone involved. If the situation requires it, this may take
              the form of a referral to an appropriate non-PyCon HK agency, including the local police. PyCon HK is not
              equipped to handle emergency situations.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the incident is less urgent, the report will be discussed by the event staff, who will meet to
              determine an appropriate response. Examples of possible incident responses are outlined in the{" "}
              <b>
                <a
                  href="/2025/code-of-conduct/enforcement-procedures"

              </b>
              .
            </p>
            <p>
              Before any large in-person gathering conference, staff will have a mandatory meeting where incident
              response procedures will be outlined. After the conference, all incident responders will attend a
              debriefing session with the lead responders to discuss all incidents and determine any necessary follow-up
              actions.
            </p>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-600 mt-8 mb-4">Following up with Reporters</h2>
            <p>
              Within one week of an incident report, a member of the event staff, or one of the lead responders, will
              follow up with the person who made the report and provided their contact information. The follow up may
              include:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1">
              <li>An acknowledgment that the Code of Conduct responders discussed the situation</li>
              <li>Whether or not the report was determined to be a violation of the Code of Conduct</li>
              <li>What actions (if any) were taken to correct the reported behavior</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              In some cases, the lead responders may need to ask additional questions about the incident in order to
              identify the reported person.
            </p>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-600 mt-8 mb-4">Conflicts of Interest</h2>
            <p>
              If an incident responder has a conflict of interest for a report, they will recuse themselves from the
              discussion and handling of the incident. The incident documentation will not be available to them, and
              they will excuse themselves from any conversations involving handling the incident.
            </p>
            <p>
              Should more than two of the PyCon HK lead incident responders need to recuse themselves, another PyCon HK
              staff member will step in as a temporary lead incident responder.
